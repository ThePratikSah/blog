The most anticipated laptop from Apple has finally been updated on 30th of October at Apple launch event  Brooklyn Academy of Music, Howard Gilman Opera House in New York. It has been 3 long years since the internals of Air had been updated and a massive 6 long years since it has got a design refresh back in 2012. But its finally here and we will help you figure it out whether is it really worth buying?


## What has been updated?

The new MacBook Air has massive improvements over its predecessor and an all-new unibody design that is made from 100% recycled aluminum. The shiny machine has all new Intel 8th generation Y-series processors, Apple's 3rd gen butterfly mechanism keyboard, a bigger force-touch trackpad, touch Id, updated speakers, a shiny apple logo that is no more backlit and the biggest of all, a beautiful new screen that you can boast about. The claimed battery life has also been increased over the previous model by 1 hour for up to 13 hours on iTunes playback and web browsing. For the added security Apple has included its all-new proprietary T2 chip that handles several procedures like Secure Boot, Storage encryption, Webcam and Microphone thus taking some load of the main processor and giving it some more room to work.

### What is the competition?

You can get a better specification Windows machine for the same money but we compare it to the MacBook Pro 2017 base model and previous generation MacBook Air.
In the competition with the MacBook Pro 2017, the Pro is by far the better performer from Photo and Video Editing to display quality, better speakers, bigger trackpad. But the 2017 base model Pro misses out on the T2 chip and touch ID. The Pro is although a better bang for your buck if you can miss out on Touch ID and T2 chip.
The case is the opposite if we compare the outgoing model Air with the new one. The new Air has better performance, both processor and graphics wise but not by much. Though the biggest improvement is the all-new Display and the massive bezels have shrunken down by 50%. Also, you get revamped speakers with better acoustics and better highs and mids. The new Air is a clear winner here and if you are a previous Air owner you must go for this but if you can spend a few bucks more then go for the 2017  Pro base model.

### Who is it for?

Apple has its Air definitely not for its Pro users but for those who prefer to compromise performance over portability. Yes, its true and you get a 7W processor but its perfect for light usage and on the run it offers a superb battery life. It's great for students and light to moderate users and is best for entering the MacOS environment if you are switching from other operating systems. And the best of all is the level of optimization that Apple provides with all its devices. Even the device is underpowered you can run a dozen apps and still can edit a photo with multiple preload effects in Photoshop. That is the level of optimization that the Air has on offer. 

#### Final Verdict

The hardware is certainly underpowered for what you pay for but still its worth what the Air has to offer. Top of the line build quality, the highest level of optimization, the best trackpad and the overall experience is just mesmerizing. But if you are going for it I would recommend laying your eyes on the base model 2017 Pro just for once.
